# CampusCircle

## What is this?

This is a simple client for getting the calendar from the _NS Solutions CampusSquare_ portal (aka _Loyola_ at Sophia University, _TWINS_ at Tsukuba University...) and outputting them in a nicer and more modern format.

## Why?

I got tired of having to log in _every single time_ I wanted to check my schedule. Also, CampusSquare is kind of slow, so loading it, logging in and then finding my schedule would take a moment.

Oh, and it `alert`s you after 15 minutes because you're logged out, which tends to steal focus on Firefox for Android.

## Other stuff

I have absolutely no connection to NS Solutions or CampusSquare, other than having to use it at my university.

## Other things you may want to take a look at

There's a client called _Twin:te_ by [HikaruEgashira](https://github.com/HikaruEgashira/twinte_frontend) which I found while making this, however this is not based on it.
